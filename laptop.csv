   Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow.  Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.",1.0,Please don't buy
This is  a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.,2.0,Not good
"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing.  I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo).  Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall  decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup.",4.0,"Decent laptop, good customer support during setup"
"Firstly for the correct information of all potential buyers - I have had a good experience of HP laptops. Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent.Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM...it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this.The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.Sound output is not that great.....so far so good. will post again after a month of use.",4.0,Reasonable performance so far (it is only 3 days)
"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days  today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use.  Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet.",4.0,Alluring Design Go for it.

"Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost  2GB ram will allocated for Graphics.

Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊",5.0,"Good laptop for students, affordable."
"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.I will update my review after 6 months.",5.0,HP 15s-gr0011au

"Totally in awe of this laptop .It’s a wonderful deal for the price. Initially being reluctant to try Ryzen but I am amazed at the speed, one may not notice the difference between intel and Ryzen . The screen calibration is upto the mark. Sound is crisp and clear.  It comes with 8GB RAM and 1tb memory which makes the machine way smoother and faster.Battery life is  good for the average usage. Like WFH and online classes. May not recommend for heavy gaming.However the only flip side is the starting time, it takes a while to start completely .Apart from this what I totally adore is the premium look it gives at an affordable price. Doesn’t look plasticky at all .It is a good buy, totally worth it!",5.0,Worth it !

Amazon lies about the specifications.There is only one USB 3.0 port. Rest are USB 2.0. There's no finger print scanner. The screen bleed is unacceptable for the price.

Way too much screen bleed.,1.0,Amazon's lies all over the spec sheet.

We thought that battery maybe drained and charged it full and tried again. It was fine working performance was good after updating the bios.  After turning off laptop and tried to turn ON laptop after few hours,it won't turn on again. Later we find out that we need to attach charger and turn on Otherwise it won't boot.

It can run through modern AAA titles in a breeze. Easily getting 60FPS in all games with high settings. Thermals are good. Screen is nice to game. Below are some tips for buyers:1.

No RJ45 port( business strategy to make u buy external USB to RJ45 convertor)4. The speaker's outlet is placed below the laptop. This minimises the sound's loudness.5. Integrated camera should have been planned. The external camera quality is quite poor6. SATA SSD is present so shifting of large files won't be very fast. Since NVme SSD is absent.7. The expandability is a huge issue in this laptop. You can't expand any hardware.In the modern times this is a a crime( not literally) on the manufacturer's part.Do's:Test for screen:-Make the whole screen black.Switch off all the lights of the room. Wait for 2 minutes. Then watch the screen. If you notice any white light getting displayed from any parts of the screen, then your laptop's screen is faulty.Hardware test;Write ""Performance monitor"" in the search bar.Then click on ""Data collector Sets""Then on ""System""Then right click on "" System Diagnostics"",then press start.After the process completes.Click on Reports-> System-> System DiagnosticsYou will be able to check the hardware report on a shallow level.Same process to be done for "" System Performance ""Note: My laptop's screen is faulty and has spots.I have ordered for a replacement.Yet to receive one.Would update with more points.After getting replacementThe last 3 pictures  are of the new replacement.

"Ordered this a little more than a week ago during the festival sale. I ve used many Xiaomi devices so even though laptops were a new territory for Xiaomi (at least from an Indian market standpoint), despite mixed reviews I thought why not give it a try considering the price to value ratio, all the while knowing that should it give me any issues I can always return it.From day one, the laptop gave me issues :1) mousepad stopped working2) usb cam does not get recognised 50 per cent of the time3) the mic is not recognised in online meetings 50 per cent of the time. Only solution is to end meeting and rejoin.4) browser hung on day 1 without multiple tabs opened.I gave it a few days but the issues were consistent and therefore I called Amazon within the stipulated deadline, to return the product as I had lost trust in Xiaomi as a laptop brand and wanted to invest in an established brand like dell,hp.First, Amazon have kept specific windows now to get hold of their team for returns 8am-12. 12am to 1. I kept an alarm so that I don't miss the second slot, as because of my shift time the first one is not possible. The rep. told me to my shock that returns are not possible anymore on electronics and I should have a technician visit and fix the issue. I told him I'm not a person who can afford to keep switching laptops and hence I intend to invest in a laptop which doesn't run into issues as I will keep it for 8-10 years. The rep. transferred the call to the manager. He repeated the samething, dealers complain to us so we changed policy. I asked them to check my purchase history, I ve been a regular customer with expensive purchases like washing machine, multiple flagship phones etc. which I have never returned. So I told them that I can understand if you say this to a habitual offender but not me.Then he said they can't see ""what options will be "" available until a technician visit happens. The other option was an online test. Since I work in shifts, I said I prefer an online test to which I was told there was no option for manager to transfer call and also the tech team didn't work at this time. I told him what's the point of having a specific slot for return calls when the relevant team doesnt function at the time.After a lengthy conversation, I wasn't left with any option but to book a technician visit. Looks like they re going to force me to stay with this laptop but I feel very cheated as I never used to consider any other e commerce company due to Amazon s customer first policy, but when it was really my turn to experience it, this is what I got.I even said I'm fine with credit of my money as Amazon balance for future purchases so that I can buy a laptop of my choice. This will give dealer s confidence to sell faulty products. Most importantly a loyal customer lost is a loss of free word of mouth publicity and there's no data on how many people that he/she shares their experience with. It all adds up. Hope Amazon wakes up sooner than later and starts respecting it's customers again (at least ones who have a clean history).",1.0,Loss of trust in Amazon's cust. first policy
"Regardless of what review you read about this laptop, dont go for it.I just recieved it, and not really confident about how my experience is going to be but my last HP core i3 lasted for 5 years and was still good.As you can see the picture taken with a black background in full darkness and see the white lights coming from everywhere. Not sure if this is normal but it doesn't give you a good feeling about future experience.Overall, its too much a risk taking just for i5 processor.",1.0,Dont buy it. Period.
"If you are not a heavy-duty person, Go for it. It gives you the best performance at this price range. If you can live with a keyboard that doesn't have a backlit feature and an integrated webcam, you will be fine.

The power back-up and UHD screen with its processing speed make it a great buy for people who enjoy watching video content and for coding...Con: I have mixed opinions on the trackpad. you have to get used to it for it to work smoothly.

I purchased a different camera for video calling.Below are my review and rating based on max 10.1. Built quality is very nice. Not so premium bt it doesn't give you a cheap look. (7/10)2. Screen viewing angle and colour is very nice. 8/103. Battery is decent but not as per my expectation. Watching video 3 to 4 hr and without video 5 to 6 hr. My expectation was with video at least 6 hr. 7/104. Keyboard is very nice quality and response is also very good. I was aware of the fact it doesn't have backlit led but after buying sometime I used in dark and that time I was missing that feature . 8/105.One more biggest drawback is no type c charging point. That could be a better feature.6. Performance wise for me daily normal usage no issue. Dont expect gaming with intel integrated graphics. Not that great.7. Heating. Actually till date never had such issue.8. Sound quality...I am happy with a laptops sound quality as I am not expecting a woofer out of it. Its decent and good.,4.0,My review after 2 month of usage
"The one thing that Windows laptops always lacked was the premium finish that Macbooks offer. Here is Xiaomi's answer to that. This could be the most finished and premium looking laptop under 50k. Great display, great battery and great keyboard! They've covered all the basics.The decision to avoid camera in Horizon edition was a wise choice considering its thin bezel on top edge. But this model had plenty of space available on top of display to add a camera. Don't know why they didn't add it. Anyway, the separate camera given together is better than Macbook's camera.Getting a battery life of about 10 to 12 hours with browsing & watching videos. More than what they promised!!Did not face overheating while charging or using Photoshop & Premiere.There is a lot of Windows updates including latest version of drivers are pending to install. Do all updates to get the best performance.Hats off to Mi for bringing this laptop to India. Hope all future models also will release here.",5.0,A true competitor for mac

"For the same configuration, you would need to pay a couple of more thousands from any other competitor. There is so much clutter in the market you will find it difficult to choose a model. This package is good - CPU, Battery life, size, compactness, HD screen with anti-reflective coating.Also, in your previous laptop if you just sync with Onedrive the move will be seamless. However, my major anxiety was about the kind of trackpad having used a Macbook for a last couple of years. It is pretty good - very responsive and smooth.A couple of drawbacks to watch out for:No backlit keyboard (Too much to ask for at this price point)No integrated webcam (will be shipped separately and may take a few days) - This will take up one slot on your USB if you are on video calls. An immediate alternative could be to use your phone as a webcam wirelessly - Quite a few apps are available for that.",5.0,A good package that ticks all the boxes and just works
Pros:1.Metal body(really well built)2.Screen quality really good3.Enough bright(not under sun)4.Really fast SSD(mine is samsung)5.Bootup speed is 11s6.Good battery life(46Whr) (around 7hrs with mixed use)7.Design(minimal and slim and light)8.Almost scrach proof(upto an extent)9.Good performance (least of my worries😁)Cons:1.Backlight bleeding(only noticeble in dark screen)2.Upgradibility(doesn't matter to me)3.Trackpad(tracking is ok but buttons are worse. Feels like it would break. I use gestures only)4.No type-C (i dont care)5.No SD card slot6.Speakers distort on high volume7.Headphone output lacks base and it distorts too.Conclusion:Has some cons but every other laptops have it too(in this price range).I say its a great laptop for the pros it delivers 💯.The external webcam does not bothers me as i dont need it.Not for gaming but can handle older titles.,5.0,Best for its price!!
"Laptop design and performance is awesome. But I want to bring in notice of Amazon official about their recent delivery scandals in mostly rural areas.Now a days all the product box are either damaged or is torned out. Like for this MI laptop the outside box completely torned out. Someone must have tried to change to rob some accessories from this box. The main box seal is already torned out.Similarly for another one product of mine, the delivery team has given a completely different brand product without any charger or accessories.Amazon team should investigate into this. I have all the supporting proof.",5.0,Scandal: Excellant Product But extremely Poor Amazon Delivery

Professionals please dont purchase this product. The screen size is 14 inch and that is very less for professionals.

So please consider this review before you purchase this creepy product. Total disappointment. From both Mi and amazon,1.0,Creepy product and very poor customer service from amazon
"Well after more than 6 months of usage now I can say that its not the best buy for the price. The battery performance now is quite poor may be around 2 hrs against claimed 7 hrs. the WiFi isn't the best at all. Drops not very frequently but quite regularly. Display, performance etc are fine for the price though. But one of the reason for my purchase was battery performance and that turned out to be poor. So not very satisfied overall.",3.0,Decent laptop BUT....
"They provide trial MS office software of a month long.So they sell cheap but once you install it,MS starts roaring to purchase new paid version.And then either purchase or compromise your data.The same old story of saying big at the time of selling ,then after the sale , asking to approach other for services .Better buy other Indian product evenif it may seem a bit costly than chinese.",4.0,A white elephant had no tail.
"I was disappointed to find that less than a month after buying this product,  I started getting display issues,  where the screen started flickering when I put down the screen. The display would come back again when I opened the laptop.  In other words i faced this problem while opening and closing the screen.I paid 45000 for this new product and already its showing defect. Didn't expect this from a Xaomi Mi product. For the last 4 days it is at a Xaomi service centre, and god knows when I will get it back.",1.0,Very disappointed due to display issues within a month !
"It's an excellent product from Xiaomi. I have been a Xiaomi phone user for many years now and hence i know the way their product performs and this was no different. A very handy product, light weight, compact and looks good too. The SSD provides a very fast boot-up and shut down operation and the 8GB RAM ensures seamless performance. I don't use it for gaming or high end graphic software and hence not sure how those would pull through but for a normal user this laptop is a gemTwo suggestions for improvement. It's always better to have integrated Webcam even though it might compromise and little bit of the screen space on the top. It's not that convenient to connect the webcam separately. Second suggestion is to have an Mi Logo embossed on the outside of the Laptop like HP, Dell and other companies do as this would give the Laptop a premium look.",5.0,Excellent Laptop..

"THUMBS UP TO 👍 XIAOMI FOR FINALLY INTEGRATING WEB CAM WITH THIS BEAUTY.First of all, stop thinking it is a low quality Chinese product. That's  not the case here. I have used laptops  from many different  brands over the years and I haven't come across something  this good at this price. Of course  if you are going to nitpick, you will indeed find some flaws but for a normal day to day user it won't matter.Note : If you want something more sleek and portable go for this acer laptop here .. Its slightly expensive but worth the extra money you pay.Like:1) ✅Really lightweight and sturdy. This is one of those laptops you can use for hours on your lap.2) ✅Display is just perfect for media and reading. Punchy3) ✅Decent battery life of 5-6 hours for such a cheap laptop. 4cell Battery.4) ✅SSD , i5, 8GB RAM. Trust me, the combination is perfect.5) ✅Webcam is actually Good if you are sitting in a well lit room.6) ✅Fast charging like this is a must for laptops. 65W# Some things to note1)🤖 RAM not upgradable : Well the majority  of users  never upgrade  a thing in their  laptop.2) No backlit keyboard3) Trackpad is not a premium one. But its usable.4) Body feels fragile.5) Mi after sales support is not something to praise. Also its not available  in every city like Lenovo, HP etc.6) Repair costs after warranty will be a bit high just like MacBook.ONE LAST THING, some users are complaining that the  Storage used is SSD SATA 3 and NOT NVME, so speed will be limited to max 500mbps. Trust me, its just won't  harm you in any way. SATA ssd is fast enough.##🔋 BACKUP IS NOT THE BEST. BUT I AM HAPPY.=========================================Talking about the battery, the charging time is very less compared to other laptops in the market. I will mention battery stats in my usage. That is, it takes somewhere around 25 to 30 minutes to charge from 50 to 100%. This is not bad, right! And talking about battery life in my usage, my usage starts with a full charge. After two video calls ( each, one and a half an hour, that is totally 3 hours), 45% of battery still remained, which is also good. So you can expect an average of 5 to 6 hours of battery life.🥸Verdict : See this is a really nice system with i5 processor that will let you do all of the productivity tasks such as word, excel, publisher, some light photo editing, light video editing, netflix, youtube, gaming etc.I hope it helps.",4.0,6 PROS // 6 CONS .

"I bought this laptop after a deep research. Was highly sceptical whether I will get a product without any defect or not. Guys let me tell you, this product is awesome. Simply smooth and impressive. Being a Chinese product, this is impressive. I went through so many negative reviews back and forth. First of all I am not bothered about backlit keyboard, finger print scanner and a CD drive. Life has to be easy and light, so it is given by this product. If I want all these missing features as mentioned above in this laptop, then I should have bought a cell phone and not a laptop. Guys you are buying laptop and not a mobile phone in which you want fingerprint scanner, backlit keyboard and so on. So far after 48hours, my verdict is, it is impressive. In the price which is mentioned. I will edit by review after 10 days and so on. As per requirement. My gut feeling is, it will remain the same which is impressive. What I loved are as follows:-DisplayFast accessSmooth touchpadAmazing built qualityVery impressive battery backupAmazingly light and thinThe processor is fastAfter continuous usage, it didn't heat-upLook and feel is satisfactoryWhat I didn't like is:-ONE MONTH MS OFFICE (TRIAL VERSION)Edited - 23rd May 2021It is working fantastically and I love it's speed.

"Its a Good Value for money Laptop.Battery life 4.5 out of 5 starsis Highest in 10th Generation Intel. (4 - 6 hours of Office work)Speed - 2.8 out of 5 stars it's OK for office work like Internet surfing, word excel PowerPoint zoom.Weight - 3 out of 5 stars.It has decent weight. Lighter than dell and heavier than atom book.I am a technician since 1998 and know much about technology in depth.Buy this if your work is simple.Buy if you want highest battery life.Buy to save money because this is the cheapest cpu out there between 21500 - 28000 range. Depends on market state and tax.* Don't buy for gaming.* Don't Buy for upgrading if you don't have experience, because this laptop needs professional hands to open and upgrade.* Don't Buy if you want to use more than 5 applications and software in single time.This laptop as per the budget is slower than the 32000 - 38000 range i3/amd.

"screen is good everything else is average connectivity is even below average as it has only 2 usb ports nun of them is 3.0 and it does not have any lan port either, its only a wifi laptop.. all ports even 3.5mm earphone jack and charging all are placed on back with usb ports so it makes a bit difficult to access them while working.. and the webcam is also places above the keyboard so can not adjust it by tilting screen have to move the whole laptop.. ram and rom both are not expendable which seems idiotic.. don't know why the company did all these stupid things and made a good product below average they could have positioned the camera and ports on right places where they normally are and could have given option to increase ram and rom and this could have been the best product in range.",1.0,AVERAGE PRODUCT
