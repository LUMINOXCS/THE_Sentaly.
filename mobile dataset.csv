Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,1,THIS IS A LOCKED T MOBILE PHONE. I KNOW IT IS
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,5,good
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,5,I bought this to connect a Nextbookkkkk tablet (from Walmart) to my T.V.; mainly to show YouTube videos on a bigger screen. It works- just plug it in.
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,4,The Zinger is a satisfactory beginning device; faster than my ZTE Avail. It could use more internal storage. Navigating is easy. The sound is very good; compatible with my hearing aids
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,1,"This phone was sold as a ""new"" phone. It had hundreds of contacts phone numbers on it, which tells me it was not new. What gives?"
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,5,VERY GOOD.
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,2,"The phone description says ""Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked"" but the phone that I received was locked to AT&T.Otherwise it is a very basic Android phone; and at $43 when I purchased, the least expensive Android phone."
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,1,Phone does not work
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,5,"This one is hard to beat for a $50 phone in 2015. Very fast and more phone then I hoped for in this price range. Storage is limited, but a great international phone for vacations out of country."
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,5,Excellent
Zte Zinger Z667t Unlocked,ZTE Corporation,39.99,4,"I see the price has gone up from a week ago. If you look for a ""no contract"" T-Mobile ZTE Zinger, it's $35, but that phone is not fully unlocked - it works only for the Brighspot reseller's service (uses T-Mobile network but not the same as T-Mobile directly. For $10 you can have this phone truly unlocked and usable with any GSM SIM and service worldwide - thus, $45 total all-in.As for the phone itself, it's a low end Android smartphone but a BIG step up from earlier plain cellphones, and will support 3G. Better still, the WiFi feature lets you use the Chrome browser, Amazon, YouTube, and the Google android apps store without using any mobile network minutes (whenever you have WiFi connectivity). Th screen is small, built-in memory is marginal, and the camera is only 2 Mpixels - nothing to get excited about, but perfectly usable for many situations.It's a shame that one has to dig DEEP to find this phone on Amazon - ""no contract"" is NOT the same as ""unlocked"" !"
ZTE ZMAX PRO Z981 Unlimited 4G LTE 13MP Smartphone (Metro PCS),Zte,149,3,"Nice phone, a bit too big. Screen 'tears' while gaming. Looks like a flash of lightning when graphics are stressed...As a gamer, this is not the phone for me... Metro pcs took the phone back, but only refunded me $80... Wasn't worth the risk."
ZTE ZMAX PRO Z981 Unlimited 4G LTE 13MP Smartphone (Metro PCS),Zte,149,5,"Only had this phone a week, but really happy with it. I like the size for easy of messaging and clarity and the camera is excellent. The battery life is also very good, much better than my Iphone 5s. My unlocked version needs a bit of expertise to get 'Metro' out of the system.I'm a happy camper."

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,3,This is probably a phone that was used very hard before.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,1,The Pnone was a piece of junkIt was all scratched up and was not cleaned off. Still had information on it from last ownerNot hapy with the person who sold it to us.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,4,This is a refurbished phone which has a few cosmetic dings but works just fine. It provides me exactly what I need in a cell phone.
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,2,"Upon ordering this item I was aware that it was used with some cosmetic damaged as described by the seller. Upon recieving the phone I became oh so aware of how ""used"" it was. This is a self proclaimed ""rugged phone"" so why is it that when I just simply flip the phone close it shuts off. I'm not dropping it from 5ft let alone 1 inch, I'm simply shutting the phone as you have to with flip phones! I've come to the conclusion that it must be the battery, either loose or something causing it to jar off the power mechanism therefore loosing battery power.Bottom Line: ""you get what you pay for"" very true statement, ""you expect to get what was described to you by seller, and then when it gets to you its all a lie and a piece of junk"" also very true of this product."
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,3,The phone was shipped dirty even though it is used should have wipe it down. other than that it's what was expected for a use phone.
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,4,I am an electrical contractor and this phone is rugged enough to handle rough work. It will take a beating and keep on ticking.
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,3,"I like flip phones, they are easily to use.I had this type of phone before it was too old to use so bought another one.The sellar said the phone was new? However a month after I started to use it the battery started to going down and I must charge it up every single day, certainly not the experience I had this phone when I ought the first one one from Verizon. Certainly not worth the $170.00 I paid for!!!"
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,"The Samsung Convoy is much sturdier than my earlier phone. It arrived quite quickly, and the Verizon personnel set it up w/o problems or extra charges."
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,first phone did not work i called them and they were great they did every thing to make me happy and to fix the problem.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,"Great phone for the person who needs to make calls, take photos, and doesn't need alot of unused apps floating about."
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,1,I purchased this phone on 6/13/2013. Upon receiving this phone it was in good condition on the outside. Once i opened the phone the keypads were badly worn. Most of the buttons were flush with frame of the phone which would tell me it was used quite a bit. I also started to experience problems with my phone shutting off randomly. After i took the battery cover off the back of the phone i noticed it was not the battery pack that comes with the phone. It was loose just enough that it wasn't making the correct connection to the terminals. I put a small piece of paper to wedge the battery in so the connection could be made. That fixed that problem the the good condition used phone. In August of this year i started to have problems with sound on the phone. I had several people tell me they could not hear me unless i screamed into the phone. I later recorded my voice while speaking into the phone and there was no sound from my voice. I then realized i was sold a junk phone with excessive wear from the seller and lied to about his posting on amazon.com that this phone was in good condition. I have sense thrown the phone away and bought another from my cell phone provider. I would not recommend buying a phone from this seller. I realize its a used phone but it should last more than two months before it breaks down....
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,4,The phone was decent and came as expected. However one of the chargers didnt work from day one...which made it hard to use the phone. So tht left me a little disappointed withthe buyer.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,2,"This phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks, (although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking). If you get a properly working phone, it seems pretty solid. The camera has bad resolution, so if you are set on a good camera, this is not for you. Overall it has good audio and is solidly built; not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not. Last night it started acting crazy. When the phone is shut, it keeps activating the ""Voice Command"" function, and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt. Then if there is noise, it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing. I also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode, therefore it is wasting my battery power. I looked into various Settings menus, but it seems there is no way to shut this function off. Secondly, it has recently started pulling up a ""No Caller ID # Available!"" Alert Message in front of every text message I get, even though I can see the person's name attached message before I try to open it. Furthermore, when I try to hit ""Ok"" to acknowledge the alert, it pops right back up, over and over again, so I can't read my texts. It does this even for old texts. I tried turning it off and taking the battery out, I even tried a factory reset function, and I'm still having the same problems. I also noticed that after I reset it, when it was going through the set up, that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all, even when they said they were, I could hear nothing! And I can't hear a dial tone when I call people. Screwed up! Hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone. It would've been good until this started."
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,4,"The product did everything I expected,would recommend this phone;or the convoy2 to anyone.Very please with the phone,thank you,very much.thanks again"

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,4,I bought this phone for my daughter.

Really he did and it worked okay except for the screen which finally died. This one is slightly different: no light, different charger connection and body glove doesn't fit perfectly, all things I can work around. I use it as a phone only and it does it well.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,3,I ordered this phone as a rugged simple phone to use which did meet those requirements. When I received the phone I started to sign up with Verizon service only to be told this was not a new phone and had already had a service plan from May 2013 to just before I purchased it as new. This raised red flags for me so I returned the phone. The refund process went through easily but I am still searching for a cell phone.
Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,This was the second Convoy we've ordered for a family member. We've found these to be a very good basic phone. The numbers light up and the buttons are just the right size for manly fingers. My husband had his in his pocket while fishing and had to step out into a pond to release a fish that was hooked and snagged on a log near the ponds edge. Little did he know when he stepped into the pond that the water was waist deep. He quickly pulled his phone out of his pocket and tossed it to his cousin. The phone had gotten wet but is still working great. After that experience his cousin had to have one too.
